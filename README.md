A night light that lights up your toilette when you enter your restroom. Inspired by [IllumiBowl](https://illumibowl.com/).


### Partlist:
. 1 ATTiny85
. 1 RGB LED
. 1 LDR Sensor
. 1 PIR Sensor
. 1 Push button
. 1 Timpot (10k)
. 2 100R Resistor
. 1 150R Resistor

![Schematics](https://github.com/fjcaetano/ToiLite/raw/master/toilite_schem.png)

The schematics and prototyping are using an ATTiny85 as microcontroller for the final product, but it can be easily exchanged for an Arduino board for tests.


### TODO
- [ ] Hook up the PIR
- [ ] Wire it up in a perfboard
- [ ] Make a housing for the product
- [ ] Install on a toilette
