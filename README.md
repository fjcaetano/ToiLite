A night light that lights up your toilette when you enter your restroom. Inspired by [IllumiBowl](https://illumibowl.com/).


### Partlist:
- 1 ATTiny85
- 1 RGB LED
- 1 LDR Sensor
- 1 PIR Sensor
- 1 Push button
- 1 Timpot (10k)
- 2 100R Resistor
- 2 150R Resistor
- 2 N-Type Mosfet (2N7000)

The schematics and prototyping are using an ATTiny85 as microcontroller for the final product, but it can be easily exchanged for an Arduino board for tests.

### Perfboard
